# Open Source Guide to Earth Observation in Development Cooperation
Methods and Guidance


**About**
While there are very sophisticated methods in remote sensing science, the approaches must be practical and easy to implement from the point of view of the users. Therefore, the focus of the Open Source Guide to Earth Observation in Development Cooperation  is on pragmatic approaches that deliver robust and accurate results that still meet scientific standards. As such, it aims to provide the basis for good practice for the application of remote sensing in project evaluation.

This is designed as a systematic review that shows how a set of dedicated project indicators can be assessed and mapped by means of analysing remote sensing data, using geographic information systems (GIS) and non-proprietary programming languages (e.g. R tools or Python), and by applying existing, globally available and preferably free data (in particular satellite images) and products (i.e. information derived from satellite images). 


**Content**
The review contains good practice guidance for assessing project impacts according to different project evaluation indicators.
